# Machine-Vision-Algorithms
This repository follows the course [**Image Understanding I: Machine Vision Algorithms**](https://campus.tum.de/tumonline/WBMODHB.wbShowMHBReadOnly?pKnotenNr=473853) (German: Bildverstehen I: Methoden der industriellen Bildverarbeitung).

I created this repo to test out various machine vision algorithms addressed in the course.

Some of the IPython Notebooks contain German terms due to the course being in German. I tried to add the English for every term, but there are definitely some where I was not sure about the translation.

Feel free to hit me up if you have any questions!
